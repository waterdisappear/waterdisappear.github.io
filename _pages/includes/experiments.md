**Master Project: Exploring the relation between cancers and mRNA with computer science methods**

- Aim to find out which combination of mRNA bases have information of cancer metastasis.
- Built a complex network based on correlations among mRNAs using Python and Gephi.
- Did network analysis to filter out informative mRNAs.
- Currently researching on more effective network analysis and machine learning techniques,
- And how to predict cancers based on the filtered mRNAs with ML models.

**Summer Research on Deep Learning & Neural Network Data Augment**

- Use pytorch to implement CNN and research on current data augmentation approaches.
- Merge 4 data augment strategies (Cutout, Mixup, Cutmix and Autoaugment) into one project code.
- Train the RNN with different data augmentation strategies on different Dataset x RNN models.
- Analyse and contrast on the experiment results.
- Come up with a new strategy called Random-mix and run experiments to test the capability.
